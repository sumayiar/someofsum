        <h2 id="section1">Happy Place</h2>
        <p>A fiction book I'm reading by one of my favorite authors. I loved "Beach Read" so I went bananas 
            when I saw another Emily Henry book at the library. I'm only four chapters in, as of 3/18/24, but
             so far it's nice. Henry's skill of adding vivid details is impeccable! It makes me want to buy a
              vacation house in Maine and eat loads of lobster!</p>

        <h2 id="section2">The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People" by Stephen Covey</h2>
        <p>This is a non-fiction book that I'm reading for self-improvement. This Spring semester has 
            been a little rough and I've been experiencing some burnout. So, this has been my handy handbook 
            towards focusing better in my studies.</p>

        <h2 id=""section2>The Alchemist</h2>
        <p>On Eid-ul-fitr, I went to my neighbor's house— they've renovated their living room! It was 
            beautifully furnished, with a teal couch encompassing the top left corner of their living room.
             But this didn't captivate me— the bookshelf next to it did! As I perused through their
              collection of books, I had noticed they had two copies of the Alchemist— one fairly 
              used and one worn out. Now, seeing a classic in a Bengali household was rare and I had to see what was so special about this book.
               So, a couple of days later I picked this book up and voila, my current read! As of 04/14/2024,
                I am reading this wonderfully written book by Mr. Coelho.</p>
