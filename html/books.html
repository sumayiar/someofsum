        <h2 id="section1">Happy Place</h2>
        <p>A fiction book I'm reading by one of my favorite authors. I loved "Beach Read" so I went bananas when I saw another Emily Henry book at the library. I'm only four chapters in, as of 3/18/24, but so far it's nice. Henry's skill of adding vivid details is impeccable! It makes me want to buy a vacation house in Maine and eat loads of lobster!</p>

        <h2 id="section2">The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People" by Stephen Covey</h2>
        <p>This is a non-fiction book that I'm reading for self-improvement. This Spring semester has been a little rough and I've been experiencing some burnout. So, this has been my handy handbook towards focusing better in my studies.</p>
