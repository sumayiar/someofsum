        <h1>Cutting</h1>
        <p>Some things I've been doing to enter a caloric deficit are walking 10k steps daily and eating clean. Right now, it's Ramadan. So, I've been fasting for about 14 hours. When it's time to eat, I'll make a protein shake with almond milk and my favorite protein powder: Vanilla Premier Protein Powder. Some days, I'll make a strawberry-banana smoothie or a berry smoothie with blueberries and strawberries. For my meals, I add in tons of veggies, beans for fiber, avocado for a healthy fat, and some chicken for protein.</p>

        <h1>Pilates</h1>
        <p>I've been meaning to explore Pilates. I'll try to document my entire journey here.</p>
