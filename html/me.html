        <h2>General Bio</h2>
        <p>My name is Sumayia Rashid (close family calls me Lily) and I currently go to Hunter College. I'm a Daedalus Scholar there, serving in the CS Honors Department— studying CS. I'm going to graduate a year early, like many other CUNY students— yipee! I do a bunch of extracurriculars, like TA for Intro to CS, secretary of the CS Club, co-chair of the Daedalus Committee, and a SAL (Student Admissions Leader). That sounds like a lot, but really it isn't. Those that are curious on how I do it— Google calendar and have excellent time management skills. I also get eight hours of sleep. Enough blabbing about school. Here's some actual interesting stuff about me.</p>
        <h2>Hobbies: the 3 R's</h2>
        <p>Racing, reading, and running. Those are my 3 hobbies. I read during my commutes, I run a mile 5x a week, and I love to race. I hope to run a marathon one day, which is why I'm trying to beat my pace day by day. I've ventured into reading non-fiction— a big jump from reading fiction constantly. Lastly, I haven't raced since last year. I'm planning to continue my 2 year streak and race this year— 2024.</p>
